<h4 align="center">Text Editor and C-based Compiler/VM in WebAssembly</h4>

<br>

This project contains the source code of the Alpha programming language compiler and virtual machine, written in C. It brings Alpha to the browser by compiling both to WebAssembly, allowing you to write, compile, and run Alpha code entirely client-side.

#### What is the Alpha Language?

Alpha is a dynamically typed, imperative, block-structured language with a syntax inspired by C and modern scripting languages. It was originally designed as part of a university compiler course.<br>

```javascript
function Fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
}

function Factorial(x) {
    if (x == 1) return 1;
    return x * Factorial(x - 1);
}

// Store functions in a table
math_funcs = [
    {"fib" : Fibonacci},
    {"fac" : Factorial}
];

inter = 10;

print("Fibonacci(", inter, ") = ", math_funcs.fib(inter), "\n");   // Fibonacci(10) = 55
print("Factorial(", inter, ") = ", math_funcs.fac(inter), "\n");   // Factorial(10) = 3628800
```

#### Language Features
- Variables and expressions with dynamic types (`number`, `string`, `bool`, `nil`, `table`, `array`, `function`)
- Functions (named and anonymous), scoping, and closures
- Control flow: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `return`
- Array and map constructors
- Operator precedence for arithmetic, comparison, logical, and unary operators
- Various library functions
- Compiles to a custom bytecode format executed by a stack-based VM
- Automatic garbage colection


#### Project Features
- Alpha compiler (Flex/Bison) and VM written in C 
- In-browser code editor with syntax highlighting and autocomplete for the Alpha language
- Alpha code examples you can run to see how the language works
- Entirely client-side â€” no server needed
